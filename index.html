    <!-- Git won't take records of changes made to my code until I intialize git on 
    my project file (repository/repo) -->

    <!-- Three stages for Git to take records of changes to your project;
        1) Untracked/modified
        2) Staging 
        3) Committed
    -->
    <!-- A commit is the save point at a particular time. The message must be descriptive because they will be used for future references. -->
    <!-- A branch is the creation of an isolated environment to test your code and to merge it later to the main/master branch -->

    <h1 class="butt">Hi there. You are learning Git.</h1>
    <h2 id="great">This is a great class.</h2>
    <!-- Merging branches...how do you merge different branches together? -->
